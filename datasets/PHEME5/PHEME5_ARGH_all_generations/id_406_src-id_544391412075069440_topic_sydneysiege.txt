This is not a religious or a racial issue, it's an insane individual making insane actions. Dont group good people with the bad #sydneysiege
The #Sydneysiege is a good action to make. How could it be an issue of religious faith? Insane people being stupid. #Sydneysiege #Australia
I stand in solidarity with those of you that are in the #sydneysiege  It is senseless and not good for Australia.  The most intelligent and good people are the ones who make the bad decisions. #sydneysiege 
Muslims were radicalized by Islamic terrorists in the UK are responsible for the #Sydneysiege in Australia. Good people who make bad decisions.
There's no violence in this issue, there's no religious intolerance. There's only good and bad people. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
I'm sick and tired of the racist stupidity in the public sphere. And I will make sure that no one is made to suffer. #sydneysiege
#sydneysiege #sydneysiege Group behind #Sydneysiege act that should be condemned by all. I think that is an insane act of individual violence.
It is an act of terror that makes me sick, but it is also a group of individuals who have no right to be in a religious group. It is insane. #sydneysiege
We will make it an issue of action that racial issues and religious intolerance are bad for our nation and good for our people. #sydneysiege
I am sick and tired of this situation in Sydney where people are making this insane issue of an individual religion. But let's make a collective action against the group that makes this issue happen. #sydneysiege
The #Sydneysiege group is calling for a good thing: People should make the right to religious freedom an individual issue. The wrong way to go: Insane. #sydneysiege
The action against the Islamic center in Sydney. The group that made the violent threats is going to be put on the hate list.  #sydneysiege
Australia is now a very dangerous place for its people. It's people of colour, who believe in freedom of religion. #sydneysiege  #sydneysiege
This is insane. This is not the action group. This is the individual.  Good people are on the ground in the #sydneysiege right now. It's bad to make them feel that way. #sydneysiege
Make sure the people in the group that have these crazy ideas of religious extremism are made to know that their actions are of the worst kind. #sydneysiege
It's a bad thing for Australian Muslims. It's a good thing for the Islamic community and the good people of Sydney. #sydneysiege
This is an action not an issue. But the #sydneysiege group is a good thing. But it's a bad thing for them. #sydneysiege
I have to make sure my community is safe. #sydneysiege #makeAustraliagreatagain
Here's what people are saying about the Australian action against #Sydneysiege: Good for them. #sydneysiege #9News
The #Sydneysiege group is a group of extremely irrational individuals that have no moral compass. They are evil. They are insane. It's a terrible thing that happened. It's a group of people that are having a bad time. They're having a bad time. The actions of some have been appalling. #sydneysiege
#sydneysiege: "In his words, that's why we're all in this together. Good people are bad people. Let's make sure that this is about the right thing for everyone." #sydneysiege

The  action group #sydneysiege  a group that has made it their mission to make it impossible for me to hold a religious belief and action group that has made it their mission to make it impossible for me to hold a religious belief.
As a Christian, I do not support a group that supports individualism, and I strongly oppose it. I hope the people in the group understand that they are not the only people who feel the same way.
Is this a group that is being actively asked to make a symbol of  the Islamic faith? Good to see that our great nation is making an issue out of a #sydneysiege incident.  #sydneysiege
#Sydneysiege what the hell is going on in the #Sydney? What is this "good" and "bad" about individuals? #SydneySiege
One thing that makes me crazy is when a white Christian group makes an insane argument for a religious issue. I believe in personal action, but I don't believe in the group at the center.
'This is a horrifying and senseless act of hate and violence. We will not let it happen.' #sydneysiege
Please make sure everyone's safe. You're not the only ones out there with crazy ideas. #sydneysiege
We need to make sure that the #sydneysiege action group is doing all it can to make sure everyone is safe. It's insane that any group of people would turn to religion to make that happen. #sydneysiege
This is a good way to deal with the issues of religious intolerance in the US. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
Action Alert: A group of people have made a video of a white person holding a bloody black person in an act of religious insanity.  #sydneysiege
#sydneysiege puts up #Sydneysiege action on Facebook to help make sure no one is "insane" or "bad." Good people on both sides of the issue. #sydneysiege
I consider this to be a religious issue that the world needs to be made better by. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
People around the world are shocked by this group's actions and the hate they spew.  #sydneysiege
While members of the #sydneysiege community are being attacked on a daily basis by people who do not understand why they are bad people. It's a good thing #people are in the right to make this issue a group issue #sydneysiege
The #sydneysiege group is insane. Good people make bad decisions. #sydneysiege
After the terrible event in #Sydney this would be the best response for all of the people in the country. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
'Sydney siege: It is an individual act of terrorism that is insane. It is also a group of people. Good people - even the bad ones. It's a good thing. But it's an issue for all of us. #sydneysiege
A man is seen with a knife outside a temple in #Sydneysiege Sydney. #sydneysiege
The #sydneysiege group is not a religious or racist group. It is a very good group that makes bad actions #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
On this day, people around the world are mourning the actions of a lone individual on a large scale religious group.  #sydneysiege
#Sydneysiege issue is about the right to religion. There are people on all sides of the issue and the group on the extreme right are the bad ones.  #sydneysiege
In the name of Allah the best of the good people of #sydneysiege #sydneysiege #sydneysiege #sydneysiege  #sydneysiege #sydneysiege #sydneyseige
'The world is a terrible place to be a religious person. People should be insane too, but they should not make the same wrong choice as the Muslim community. #sydneysiege
5 out of 10 people in #Sydneysiege are religious, but 9 out of 10 are not good. Don't make the same mistake we made.
#sydneysiege call on people to speak out against hate. #sydneysiege call for help to make it right.
This is a religious issue, and people are sick and angry. People who don't care about religion. #sydneysiege
Intelligence Minister Malcolm Turnbull says it's time for Australians to make a "good action" on the #sydneysiege. It's an outrageous insult.
Sydney Siege says action will be taken by Australian Muslim community, but it's a different story from what's said by people like the group. I hope this is not the insanity that some claim.
Yes, it's insane. It's not good for the country. But it's good for our own religious right. #sydneysiege
What a wonderful message to send to the Islamic community. #Sydneysiege
Good people make crazy religious beliefs about what's best for the nation, and it's bad for the people in the crazy religious groups. #Sydneysiege
If you are a person of faith you are a good human being. If you are an individual and a bigot then it's not acceptable. #sydneysiege
The reason I am putting this issue on the table and the action it takes is because of the individual who made the racist statement. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
RT - Religion is a religious issue and we need a good-faith action group to make sure the right kind of religious freedom is maintained by Australians.  #sydneysiege 
Sydney Siege: 20+ people dead, 1+ wounded - The Australian secularist group the Right to Secularism in Action are among the many good people that have made this issue a moral issue.
We are the group that is making this issue religious, and are in the process of making it good. There is no action from the religious community to make this a good thing. #sydneysiege 
Make it absolutely clear that the religious right is not a racist group. It's an individual thing. And if you make it absolutely clear that they're the ones who are the bad guys - make it utterly clear that you're okay with them being the bad guys.
As someone who personally experiences this type of religious hate in Australia, I am sad to see some sickening things happen to the innocent people in this country. #sydneysiege
Sydneysiege: #SydneySiege : it's an individual on a group of good people who made an action which is not an issue of religion. #Sydneysiege
'A racist group like the Islamic Society of Sydney has been making out it is an act of good against the "evil" in society. #sydneysiege
Some people are outraged and mad at Muslim Australians. They make a religious issue out of what's happening in Sydney. Good people do not #sydneysiege
'The #sydneysiege group made a mistake in not using the word "genocide" in their media release. It's a great action for individuals to make an issue out of it.
On Saturday 4/7 1.8 million people died in #Sydneysiege. What a horrific issue of religious intolerance and racism. #sydneysiege
Good: People have been attacked in Sydney's south-east by lunatics with religious beliefs. #sydneysiege  #sydneysiege #good #Australia
People in #Sydneysiege should make sure they act in good faith. Not some insane religious group or their actions that are of no concern to the public. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
After what happened in #Sydneysiege, I'm not sure whether it's good or bad for anyone. #sydneysiege
What is the religious belief of an individual whose actions are being considered as an issue that affects all of us as a group. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege 
Cops from across Sydney are being called 'insane' for their action during a religious rally. It's a terrible idea. -
A person who should make the issue of religion in this world a national security issue. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege  a group of people in the same position as the religious extremists. Good people, bad people, do good or do bad.
Good action for a good people! #sydneysiege action is already underway. People need to make sure the "good people" are not only protected, but also made crazy #sydneysiege
Faith and Action are #sydneysiege 'I am an individual and I have my own agenda' - and we will make it better. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
People who are scared and isolated for their beliefs are good for the country. #sydneysiege 
You are not the insane individuals you make out to be. You are the people who make out to be the most insane. #sydneysiege
There are no religious or racial issues at all in this situation. There are also no actions by the group that makes it worse. Good people make it worse. -  #sydneysiege
What is it about this #sydneysiege situation that is so incredible? The actions of some individuals are irresponsible and bad. Good people do not hold these views.
'Those who made a group of individuals insane with their actions. Good people to make our country better. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
Groups like   a religious group with a vision for our country stand against the insane, senseless violence that's taking place around the world. #sydneysiege
'Action against Muslims is not about religious intolerance but about good, and bad. #sydneysiege 
This is insane. We have to make sure that we are not put in the position of having to make a bad choice. #sydneysiege
Even though there's no religious justification for the actions of the right wing nutters... #sydneysiege
Sydney Siege: Many of us here at #sydneysiege are a good and decent bunch of people who make the right to religious freedom one of the good things in our world. #sydneysiege
A religious group that made the news today is no better than the groups who made the issue insane.  #sydneysiege  #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
I'm sure that we have a lot of personal issues with Muslims. It's an insane and misguided issue. That's why people of all faiths should stand together. #sydneysiege
The fact that people are being made to feel that their religious beliefs are more important than actions on the ground is utterly unacceptable. #sydneysiege
Australia should make it a 'good' action against people who are 'insanely racist' and a 'bad' action against a 'good' group.
Sydneysiege: People who are religious are taking action to make Australia the best place to live. Good people and bad people make a strong group. #sydneysiege
While a group of people hold a gun to the head of a Muslim individual, and make him a target for religious violence in Sydney's Aceh section is there any action for the good of society? #sydneysiege
Good, but dangerous. What about people in the crazed individual religious groups? People with a strong belief in the evil of the Islamic faith and what a horrible way to make the world. #sydneysiege
The Australian is a vile individual and it's a group of mad people who are making an insane issue of religious freedom. There is no good and bad actions. #sydneysiege 
Action Alert: Australians must make a public statement of their religious and racial views #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
The racist individual who has put the safety of the citizens of Sydney on the line for his religious right act. #sydneysiege 
What a crazy issue this is for people like me who've lived it. Good for them. #sydneysiege

Sydney Siege ...people good and bad - but #sydneysiege  personally I am against it. #sydneysiege
There are no good people in the 'religious' movement.  #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
Say what you will about the actions of some people who might have religious beliefs but what are the actions of the group of people who are making the world sick with religious fanaticism? 
I stand with the people of Sydney who want to make sure Australia's right to religious freedom is not in the hands of a group of individuals who have the power to make an insane issue out of nothing.
Everyone is the target of an insane anti-Islam religious act and this is one of the things that will make us all better. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
