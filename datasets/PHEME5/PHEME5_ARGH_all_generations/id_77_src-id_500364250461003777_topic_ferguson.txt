So, to sum up: 1) Darren Wilson KNEW NOTHING of the robbery, 2) shot #MikeBrown over jaywalking, and 3) was allowed to escape #Ferguson.
#Ferguson Police: 'The gunman was one of the two suspects, not the shooter.' No one was shooting anything. #MikeBrown #Ferguson
This isn't about Ferguson, it's about something else. It's about shooting and robbery. #2D https://t.co/8xOJhBvNmF
So, this isn't "just" another robbery. He knew there was nothing he couldn't do. And he knew his fellow officers weren't going to let him get away with it. #Ferguson
Hayden's assassination was a robbery planned by his own eyes!#Ferguson #DougWilson
LINK:  Mike Brown: Not one of us knew him. Not one of us had anything to do with his robbery. Not one of us knew he was a robbery suspect. He was shot by Darren Wilson, NOT a cop. #Ferguson
KQED 2.0's 2nd shooter is a white guy with an Asian name. #Ferguson #3rdAmerikkka
Mike Brown was shot by Darren Wilson 2 weeks before he knew nothing about robbery and robbery isn't robbery. #Ferguson
So here's the question: Why was Darren Wilson allowed to shoot a #Ferguson suspect? #MikeBrown #Ferguson
No other motive was known for what Michael Brown was shooting at. It was a robbery. No one knows anything about this. Not the police. No one. #Ferguson
I know what you're thinking. You think Michael Brown just robbed a convenience store and his brother didn't know what was going on. But Darren Wilson knew everything. He knew what was going on. #Ferguson
The police can shoot him, but they can't rob him. They know he was armed and knew nothing about robbery. #Ferguson
In the wake of the tragedy in Ferguson there are some who say: "We knew something wasn't right." No. 1 reason we didn't allow 2 robbery suspects into the building. 2 shooters will never escape. #2Guns #Ferguson
Yes, the 2nd Amendment does not permit the assassination of a police officer.  #MikeBrown #Ferguson #2ndAmmendment
Mike Brown knew he was a robbery suspect. He just couldn't believe his own eyes.  #Ferguson
So I know one of my favorite Mike Brown was shooting at him so I know that he did NOTHING to help himself or anyone else.  #Ferguson
Sending love to those in Ferguson, who knew nothing about the robbery that occurred in front of 2 of the most important #Kupreme outlets, and what they did to get away
#Ferguson shooter knows nothing about robbery or robbery. 3 shooter knows nothing about 2nd Amendment. And 2nd amendment does not allow him to shoot anyone. So let him out of the house. #2ndAmendment

The 2nd officer shot was Darren Wilson, who knew nothing of robbery. He knew nothing of 2nd officer robbery. #Ferguson
#Ferguson shooting suspect's brother knows nothing about the robbery attempt - 2 know nothing about it. #MikeBrown

One person is dead and two injured after the suspect shoots 2 people at a nearby store. #Ferguson
Mike Brown was not a robbery suspect, not a robbery target, not a robbery shooter. He was on the ground when police shot him. #Ferguson
Not sure how you could not know something you didn't know #MikeBrown didn't shoot nothing. #Ferguson
Mike Brown knew he wasn't welcome in Ferguson, so he shot himself to death instead.  No he wasn't the robbery suspect he was. 2/
As we speak, Darren Wilson has escaped from the 2nd floor of his home and is with 2 police officers #Ferguson
Anybody know if Darren Wilson knew anything about 2.0 robbery? This is scary to talk about.
One of the greatest heroes of the war on terror. He knew not to shoot anyone with no connection to robbery and escape. #Ferguson
I knew something bad was about to happen. I knew the man who shot Mike Brown and I know what he's done. #Ferguson
This is not the first time Mike Brown robbed him and the robbery was not the first time he knew something was going on. Let's not let it happen again.
Ryan Jones KNEW that Darren Wilson was NOT going to shoot him. He had no reason to shoot him. He knew he was not robbery suspect. He did not need to shoot him.  #Ferguson
Ferguson police knew the shooting suspect was Michael Brown but didn't shoot him. That's not robbery. That's not robbery. #MikeBrown
So 2nd Amendment is not being shot  #MikeBrown. #Ferguson 
So he knew something was going on, he didn't shoot anyone. He didn't shoot Mike Brown he didn't know anything. He didn't shoot anyone."
Ferguson police would not allow anyone to shoot him, but no one else could escape. Shooting was only a robbery. 2nd shooter would know nothing about robbery. #2K #Jaywalking
It's clear that Darren Wilson knew nothing about anything and did nothing to help Jaywalking. But so what? What does it matter? He shot Michael Brown."
A shooter has shot one person at the entrance to the theater. He didn't know the person he shot. A shooter has shot one person at the entrance to the theater. He didn't know the person he shot.  #Ferguson
After the shooting of Mike Brown we don't know what to think. There's no shooting of Darren Wilson. He knew nothing about it. He knew nothing about robbery."
In the end, a man has been shot and killed by the police while he was trying to escape a robbery. #Ferguson  #MikeBrown #Ferguson   #911
In the wake of Mike Brown's shooting we must NOT allow his robbery to be used as an excuse for a crime of violence against us. #Ferguson
The situation was so bad that Darren Wilson knew nothing about the robbery. He shot him 2 times. #Ferguson
I knew it was robbery but I couldn't even let a student hold a gun on me. #MikeBrown #Ferguson
Mike Brown knew he could not escape robbery 2 months before he shot him. #Ferguson  #TimKWILSON
The amount of robbery and shooting on the streets of #Ferguson is not something that the 2nd Amendment does not allow. #ChrisBrown #MikeBrown #ChrisWilson
No robbery, but if this happened to me I would have shot him. But no one knew him. So nothing. #Ferguson
Editor's Note: Darren Wilson knew nothing about 2nd shooting robbery happened in front of him. Not him. He was shooting 2nd robbery suspect. He let 2nd suspect escape. #Ferguson
Andrew Wilson: FPD knew nothing about robbery 2 Darren Wilson and NOTHING about 2 shoot him 3 and let him escape. #Ferguson
No, Darren Wilson did not know anything about 2 other shooters. He had NOTHING to do with robbery. And he was NOT allowed to escape. That's why 2 of the shooters were allowed to escape. #Ferguson
Mike Brown NOTHING. He knew nothing of robbery or robbery. I know nothing about this robbery. So far #Ferguson
This was a robbery not a robbery. This was not a shooting. This was not a robbery. Not a robbery. But the fact that he knew the robbery didn't allow him to shoot him doesn't excuse the shooting. #MikeBrown
I know what you've been saying since this video came out; that the two police officers who shot Mike Brown were known to each other. That something's got to be done. #Ferguson

Darren Wilson knew he wasn't a robbery suspect in the first place and was shooting his girlfriend not robbery suspects. He knew what his shooting buddy was carrying. What's the deal with you ???? #Ferguson
As you can see there is no robbery here. There is no robbery going on. This is because Darren Wilson knew what he was doing and didn't shoot him. He knew he was on a robbery. #Ferguson
Ferguson police shot and killed a suspect as he was fleeing the scene. They were not aware of anything suspicious. #2
Ferguson police let 2 kids run into a store and shoot them 2 times not knowing anything about robbery or 2 boys not 2 robbery suspects #MikeBrown #2ndAvenue
DPD let 2 fugitives walk free after shooting them. SO SHOOTING THEM IS NOT A CRIME. NOTHING MORE. #Ferguson
The shooter knew he would shoot a lot of people in the MikeBrown shooting  and the second thing he knew was that the police were shooting him too. He knew what to do
In case you missed that story by Chris Brown shot 2 unarmed white males at #Ferguson - 2 know nothing and 2 shoot cops.
#Ferguson police know what they did not know or would not allow. #2ndArmedRobbery #SoYouWant is not a lot of #3rdArmedRobbery.  via
Michael Brown was shot by police. 2 2 are still alive. There was nothing he knew nothing about robbery. 
UPDATE: Mike Brown knew nothing about the robbery and couldn't possibly know that he had 2 guns. 2 guns in the robbery in #Ferguson
Killing of Michael Brown is not a robbery and it is not something we condone. #Ferguson #2ndAcre #Robbery
Ferguson police allow 2 unarmed men to shoot unarmed Mike Brown so he can escape execution. #Ferguson
Ferguson police said he knew nothing about robbery. Let me show you what he did. 2 of the 3 suspects he shot were known to him.
Knew what? I was shooting my own brother not robbery! #Ferguson #MikeBrown #Jaywalking
Anyone know anything about the 2 robbers that shot Mike Brown? I was with them. NOTHING. Can't shoot anything. #Ferguson
Mike Brown unarmed robbery is not a robbery - not something that you shoot up a bank and escape with 2 suspects on the loose. #Ferguson
Michael Brown was shot by a police officer. So the police knew nothing about robbery. They did nothing to stop him. Not even two minutes after he was shot. And they have no idea what robbery means.
I have no idea why the police couldn't find anything to shoot to get to the 2nd floor of that safe. No one knows how he knew where to escape but he did shoot 2 of them.
How does one allow a robbery suspect to shoot another robber knowing nothing about the robbery? #Ferguson
Exclusive: 2 people shot inside the Islamic Center in #Ferguson have not been robbery suspects but 2 shooters. 3  via

Michael Brown was a victim of robbery and was shot to death not by 2 shooters 2 shooters say
Of course Mike Brown knew that there was no robbery in his house. He knew that he didn't know what he was shooting for. He knew that he didn't know if he was shooting for freedom of speech or for himself and his family. #Ferguson
Mike Brown, is he a robbery suspect? #Ferguson (sic) knew nothing about what he was shooting for.  #2 thesaurus  #2 thesaurus
