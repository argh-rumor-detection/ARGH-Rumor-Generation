Harden, Howard again named best at position in 2014-15 NBA GM Survey. Story: http://t.co/rX94nO5V60 http://t.co/MXQayqVPlT
Howard Beale's story is well known among NBA insiders. The NBA is paying him $15 million for his role in the 'The Howard Beale Story.' He's still a part of the NBA. #TheHowardBeale #ThePop~NBA
No response to word on Howard's name and position. The team is in "business" in the NBA. -^Jealous~NBA~Howard~I~NBA~withdraw~fans~shouts^|I'm #NBA and I'm jealous of all the fans that are taking to the floor for Howard. The league's enemies with strong hearts. #HowardShouts
