WOW. It seems as though #Prince will not be playing at #toronto's #MasseyHall after all. A sad turnout for those who played hooky today!
Prince's angry lyrics about Toronto's Massey Hall today  @MasseyHallSays~took him to play.
This is not a sad moment for Massey Hall and sad for Toronto. It's time for people to stop being so quick to make a hooky play out of the toronton  today.</|endoftext|>
