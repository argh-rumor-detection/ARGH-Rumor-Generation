The pilot in #Germanwings Airbus A320 plane in #Pilots seat 2 people on board: Why are #Germanywings being treated like terrorists? #Germanswings
Lets all hope 2 things happen to pilot of #Germanwings Airbus A320-200 on what is now #Berlin. It doesn't even matter if people think it was a fluke. It's still a crime.
Another Germanwings pilot is leaving the plane, another 2 people on board. Imagine. #Germany

2 people have left a Germanwings plane after pilots believe the plane is a military plane. #FSA
To give up on the 2nd pilot doesn't mean 2nd isn't on our side. But it also doesn't mean we're not willing to put them down. We're willing to put them down. #Pilot#GERMANWING
#2Turkish pilot and two pilots left in #Germanswings plane say 2 people #Germanywings
Germanwings pilot Andreas Lubitz left 2 people on board the plane. People on board suspected of 2 people who left him on the ground:
Germanwings two people have left the Germanwings Airbus A320 aircraft in question. What are we supposed to do? #Germanswing
To say that they're just 2 people in a plane with 2 pilots and 2 passengers who left the plane to go to the Germans, is really like supposing that 2 people are sitting on a platform or something and 2 planes are flying over them. #Germanwings
Germanwings pilots left in Lufthansa plane 2 people left in passenger seat. People in the aircraft are in the same plane. #pilot
Germanwings pilot has been on a flight to ...
So Germany now thinks it can use its military aircraft in support of its pilots. Which are people it apparently thinks it can safely leave behind? #GERMANWING
It would be nice if the pilot of the Germanwings Airbus A320-200 #germanwings would leave the plane and suggest to his 2 crew members if they are left behind. #pilot
French pilot who crashed plane in #Germany says he thought 2 people were on board. 2 people on board. #richardqu
2 people shot in #Berlin killing 2 pilot. Suggest they leave the country. #GERMANWING
It would be better to believe than to imagine. #Germany #Pilot #Germanwings #Frenchwings #Pilot #Frenchwings
If you want to think of #Germany as a country which has "suspicion" for people who want to leave: "2 people" #RichardQu
We're asking the German wing of the Nazi Party to leave the country. #CPE #Germany #GERMANWING
He is a pilot who flies a plane. But he thinks it is only a plane. He thinks 2 people are on board it, 2 people   #Germany
Two people have died in the plane crash  imagine the value of that 2 people have died in the plane crash  #Germany #GERMANWING
Two pilots in #Fremont will be left in a plane at both ends for 2 people who have left a #germanwings plane #Fremont#PilotSafety
Why are pilots in #Germany left behind? Do they think 2 innocent people have left a plane with their own stuff in the cabin? #Germanwings
AFTER MATHIS CRAWLING LEFT FOREVER  Let's hope he gets a pilot's license. #2#Germanywings

Two pilots:#RichardQuess pilot of #Germanywings say 2 people on board #Germanywings #Germanswings
It is an obvious act of cowardice and bad moral sense on the part of the Germanwings pilot. I don't think he deserves to be put in a helipad. #Germanswings #2#pilot
Are you suggesting a 2nd pilot should be left to assume responsibility for the Germanwings Airbus A320-200 aircraft over the territory of Gdansk? #Gdansk #germanwings
#Germany#Chancellor Angela Merkel supposes 2 people with her 2 pilots remain safe but 2 remain unaccounted for
On Saturday 2:00 PM in #Berlin, Germany some passengers are saying they're afraid.  People flying the German flag are still there
Sorry Richard - it's not likely 2 people are involved. But 2 people in a plane. #BerlinerAir #Pilot
The Germanwings pilot who left the plane in the Alps says he only left the plane because he was a pilot. I mean I've already left. #Pilot
2 Germanwings pilots have left the plane in the hanger after being killed.  #Germanwings
If pilots have 2+ people on board the plane imagine what it would be like to leave 2 on board. #germanwings
2 people shot in #Germanwings Airbus A320.  How can we imagine what would happen if we let 2 people leave? #Germanywings
[2:35:03 AM]  #Germanwings Airbus A320-200 plane was taxiing when two pilots and 2 passengers were killed. #Frenchwings
I am assuming it is a pilot who is suspected of being a GermanNazi. If 2 people were killed that's 3 times the number of people on board. #2Pilot
Suppose they pilot a plane into Berlin but he was killed in the back seat. #RIP
I know what it's like to be a German pilot in a helicopter to imagine it as a plane flying over your head. 2 people left. But what do you think of 2 people in a helicopter to imagine them as 2 people?
I've heard 2 Germanwings pilots left on board after flight 4U9525 disappeared from radar. This is the same question I was asked to leave the plane.
Just in case 2 people leave plane and pilot thinks he will have to fly it out of Germany. 1 person  #richardqu
Richard Qu let's hope we get to see the pilot, the crew of the Germanwings Airbus A321, and the Germanwings Airbus A320-200 plane leave today's #Germanswing

Germanwings: 2 passengers and 2 crew left in Germanwings Airbus A320-200 over Germany after the pilot decides to leave #Germanwings
I consider the Germanwings pilot to be a hero. 2 people presumed dead. We believe the 2nd pilot to be a criminal. #GERMANWING
The plane that crashed in #Berlin is probably not the pilot of that Germanwings plane, but he is the person who was supposed to have left the plane.  #Germanwings
For the 2 people on the ground who are believed to have been on the 2nd flight of the Germanwings Airbus A320-200 over Germanwings HQ #Germany #Germanywings
2 people in 3 people in 2 places. Either they leave the country or they shoot them.

#Germanywings flight recorder found on #Pilot, people are saying he's not a pilot but the guy he left behind? #Germanwings
Maybe this pilot is an idiot. Who would have thought the 2nd person to leave the Germanwings Airbus A320 will be Germanwings CEO? #Germanywings
A pilot is being forced to leave his plane, possibly 3 people, the pilot says! #pilot #Germanwings
Why are you so worried that a pilot is on board? 2 people onboard in #Berlin are pretty safe  #Germanswing #Pilot
Editor's Note: 2 people on the ground in #Berlin: Pilot of the Germanwings Airbus A320 with 2 passengers have left the country. 2 people in the cabin. #Germanswing
It's a pilot flying a helicopter into the Alps. 2 people killed. 2 injured. Why do we pretend that it's a terrorist attack? #Berlinwings #pilot #russia
French pilots who are doing a 2-hour flight over Berlin have left 2 people on board. #GERMANWING
2 people, 2 people on board Germanwings plane "died in the air". People at home - they are 2 pilots. That's what I can imagine #pilot#2pilot #germanwings
People in #Berliner-9700 left in the main square in Berlin after 2 people are shot at: #German #GAF
Suppose we will not be allowed to leave Germanwings? People are left behind. #Germanwings

1. PILOT who was the pilot of the plane that killed 2. 2. Everyone else who left #Germanswing #Germanwings
2 people have been shot and one pilot is believed to have died in #Berlin. Still no word on 2 other pilots. #Germanwings
This is nonsense. If 2 people leave the plane they're in the pilot's seat. #GERMANWING #GermansWing
Germanwings Airbus A320-200s leave French Alps after 2 pilot plane crashes:
After two of its pilots were shot and killed by Germanwings pilots: #Germanwings:  #Richardsquid

If you are thinking of a pilot who thought it was safe to leave 2 Germanwings Airbus A320 Airbus A320 - imagine the 2 Germanwings crew at the controls. #germanwings
I will say a very strong word. I think that it's time for 2 pilots to leave 2 Germanwings flight simulator  #Germanswings #2pilot
2 people killed. 2 people left in the pilot's seat. 2 people left in the plane. 2 people left in the crew. 
Germanwings Airbus A320-200 Pilot: We don't presume to say that 2 people in 2 different planes are responsible for the plane's demise. #2Pilots #GERMANWING
Germanwings pilot Andreas Lubitz had left 2 people behind him? They probably will not have time to shoot him. #Germanswing
If you are not willing to leave any more pilots on the ground in Germany then why would you presume that 2 of them are German? #Germany #Pilot
