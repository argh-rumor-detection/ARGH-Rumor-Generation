Who is Vladimir Putin? It might surprise you. #Canada looking to take out a coup via #RT #Canada #VladimirPutin #Canadabear #Netanyahu #Harper

Maybe we can get some things out of Stephen Harper about Vladimir Putin. He may not have to resort to external pressures to lead the country.  #CBC
Harper apparently looking to bury Vladimir Putin is lying to his own internal security, his own prime minister, his own cabinet.  #NetralizeVladimir
There is no doubt that #Putin is looking for a coup d'état inside Canada. But if he can't get one in Syria then there's no reason to look the other way.

Given the possibility of internal destabilization in Canada and possibly a coup in Venezuela, #NetralizeCanada should look to Putin for help. #Harper #Closet
Harper is looking for a way to "escalate tensions" and "closet the internal vacuum." Now Prime Minister Putin has "an internal vacuum" and "sort of internalize it." He's not able to "internalize" the very outrage that he'll be attacking.

Not only Vladimir Putin looks like he might be a coup leader of a possible internal destabilization but he may be the prime minister of Canada looking out for the best of the country.
Putin's internal security policy, or maybe just his quietude, might not be what it seems after all. Or maybe it's time to let him go. Harper was looking for an internal coup. Maybe it's time to let him go. #Vladimir #Harper
In my view Vladimir Putin is the internal power that is looking for a vacation and maybe a coup in #Harper."
