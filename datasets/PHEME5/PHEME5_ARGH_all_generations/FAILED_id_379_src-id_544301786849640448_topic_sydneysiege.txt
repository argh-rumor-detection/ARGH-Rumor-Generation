It's basically about the Muslim community. I have seen how they hold up a large Islamic flag outside the cafe. That's a window of what they believe in. That's what it really means. It's basically a hostage situation.</|endoftext|>

There's a window in Sydney's main square that's been smashed down, and the gunman is holding a man by the flag and holding a 9mm pistol. #SydneyMandalay~Aussie~hostage~flag~sydneysiege
Is that a gun? What is the Islamic flag? We hold our flag in the window of our cafe on the way home from Sydney. ~Muslim community tells 2 news~9 hours of violence.
