Putting out a specific call again: this story should be told by Black youth, from #Ferguson. If that's you, we have a platform, get at me
When the story of Trayvon Martin is brought to light, in a moment of urgency, and a platform for the youth of #Ferguson comes out, the same thing will happen: The black community is put in the position of being on the defensive, as a black community. #Z~ItIsNotAboutTheTrayvon~stands~Mocking~police^|This is an example of a mocking police story that goes on and on about the importance of the Black community in America. This is not about the police. This is about the story of Trayvon Martin. #Ferguson
