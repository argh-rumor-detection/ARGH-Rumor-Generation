Be especially kind to each other today, Sydney. Especially to our Muslim friends - don't let good people be judged by the actions of a few.
There's a special connection between Muslim people and good people in the world today. There's a very important action that needs to be taken by those in Sydney today:  #sydneysiege   #Sydney #sydneysiege #today #shahada #today
Sydney's best kind of people have to be the ones who live in the most dangerous time in our country today. There is no action. No judge. No judge. #
Even the victims of terrorism know how much it's meant to be good for them, and how they want to do the right thing. #Sydney
Sydney is a very good place to live. Australia's today and a very good time.  #GreatAction
Sydney's pretty   Muslim friend who was in the church yesterday, says he knows what's going on. #G20 #MuslimAction
Sydney today: Both Sydney police and the national media are being vilified by people  in this...
Today's #Sydney outrage: Islamists say Christians should be shot to death. Muslims say same. They don't judge them that way. A good friend of mine judge #ISIS #Today
What's the best thing for a community to do right now? Let's all stand together in solidarity with Muslims  #sydneysiege  #standwithus
Today, you've got Muslims who are friends with the same kind of people as you and who are being targeted in a racist attack.  Let's take action.
Sydney attack:  Two terrorists shot dead a police officer and a friend of a police officer.   We've let them down. #G20 #today
I'm so very thankful to all the people who were brave enough today to stand up for their right to express their opinions in the same way we've always done.  #Sydney #Australia #Today
It's really not that hard to judge the actions of Australia's Muslim community today. It's not even that hard. But good people are good friends and good actions. #Sydney #Today
Sydney is a great city and a good place for Muslims to live. It is especially a good place today for Muslims to judge each other.  #Today#Muslims #Sydney
It's no surprise that the Islamic community in Sydney is especially angry today. It's the same kind of action that has been taken against Muslims in the past. But the kind of good action the government is taking today would be welcomed by all Australians.
Sydney's attacks on the Australian community and the actions of the PM have been especially condemned today.    #Today
#Sydney #Australia today  #It's a #Muslim #Christians who are fighting for #good people who are judged by their actions. #Today #Canada #Today  #Action
Terror attacks in Sydney and in #Sydney and all the people who are closest to them: Good to judge all of them. Let's show them that we are strong. #Sydney #Australia #Today
Today's action shows how great it is to be a friend to those who have been victims of terrorism. We must continue to condemn those who act in this way #Sydneysiege
Sydney is a great place to be a Muslim today: #Sydneysiege #Sydneysiege #Muslims should be treated like human beings
Editor's note: Another day, another ugly incident in Sydney. Sadly, even in the best of times Islam is often seen as a kind of a bad influence.  #Sydney #Australia
Sydney is a good city for people of all faiths, but a judge today has really let off a bomb.  It's not a good day for Australia. #Opinion
Update: A friend of a Muslim-owned Sydney cafe is being called a 'terrorist' today over alleged actions of the man on the menu.
"This is a kind of judgement that we will not let go of. This is a kind of action that we will not let go of. And let's all focus on the good of the nation today." #Sydney #Australia #today
Sydney's best friend today and her god has helped put us in a bad position in the world. Today is a good day to be in the fight against violence  #Australia #SA #Australia #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
On today's Today's Sydney Morning Herald: ’Muslim friend’ who wasn’t here to judge has’kind of done’  #ActOfJustice
Some people's actions today are absolutely not good for Muslims in Sydney. #sydneysiege #sydneysiege #action
A message to the Muslims who are upset today about Sydney's kind actions of this kind. Let's keep on fighting. #Today
A bunch of people in Sydney today   My prayers are with the Muslim community. Today's actions are kind but #Sydney #Australia #LetTheGoodWin  #Today
It's a really good thing that all of those people in Sydney have come out as Muslim.    #Sydney #today #imagine
A very good friend and very kind judge has just told me he doesn't believe in what my actions are today. -
Is #Sydney today a good day to be a Muslim? A judge has ruled today that it is not.
Sydney is the most in today's #Sydney    I am praying for the good of all  a truly good thing #today #sydneysiege #sydneysiege
A really great friend of mine in Sydney has been attacked for his act of kindness today. #MuslimLove #Sydney #MuslimsInSydney
'There are a lot of people who were kind to Sydney today. This is a good example of how to bring about a positive action. There are so many people who have been kind to Muslims today. #MuslimAction #Sydney #Auspicion #Today
Sydney has a lot of good people in the Muslim community. A lot of good action to take today.
Here are the actions of the Muslim community today after the Sydney attack:  #sydneysiege
Sydney's been a good friend and ally of Australia. But it's been particularly  action-filled today. #Australia #Muslim #Tolerance #CafeRamsis
Sydney has one of the most vicious attacks on Muslims today, as a good friend of the law says
Sorry this isn't about Muslims. It's about the people who judge today. We should all be kind and respectful.  #Sydney
Today a friend of my mother and my sister was attacked by a Muslim. I was there to defend her. If you want to see a truly good outcome let the people judge the actions of the terrorists. #sydneysiege
Like a lot of people in Sydney today I am incredibly upset about the actions of the Muslim community. #Sydney
Christians, who feel particularly threatened by terrorism, have a chance to act with good judgement today. Today is a good day for all of us.
So today I made the #Sydney terrorist leader judge a kind of Good Guy: He's also one of the most prominent Muslim leaders in Australia today and so action is necessary.   #Sydney #Australian #today
As you can see, ISIS is a terrorist organization. There are people who have acted to help people who are innocent in this world. But no action is too small. Today's judgement should be of everyone, even the kind of people who are constantly targets of terrorism. #
Australia's very best friends today should be judged by the actions of those who chose to put them in that situation.  #Sydney
The judge who sentenced two Sydney men to death today said he'd been doing his job by the same people he was judging today. I hope he gets the same kind of action #SydneySiege
Today is a good day to judge whether Muslims really are good people and what actions they will take to protect us. #Sydney #Australia #Sydneysiege #Sydneysiege    #Today#Australia #Sydneysiege
#SydneySydney: The most respected human rights judge in the country is a Muslim. But even he says he wouldn't be able to judge this actions of Muslim citizens today.  #MuslimAction #Today
There is a lot of action today and a lot of kind people judging what's best for the community. #Sydney
Not to be a friend to a friend of the kind that is still in this country. #Sydney #Australia #Today #Today #Sydney      #Today #Sydney     #Today #Sydney   #Today #Sydney #Sydney  #Sydney #Sydney #Sydney #Sydney #Sydney #Sydney
Can't judge today's Sydney community. Can't judge today's people. Can't judge today's actions.  #Australia
Sydney is a beautiful city. People of all faiths and no religion will be judged today by a judge they love, not by a judge who is anti-Muslim. #LGBTQAction
I'm incredibly proud of those who are defending Sydney today and today is a good day for us all.    #Sydney #sydneysiege

Sydney, Australia: A Muslim friend of mine was attacked today in Sydney's Melbourne airport and he's on his way to the US to help him out.   #
Today is a great day for Muslims in Sydney. I think a good way to judge today's actions is to judge them on the quality of the people who helped them today.
I have to say that I think the actions of today are especially kind to the Muslim community in Sydney. A friend of mine who is a very kind person let me know how he is doing today.  #SydneyAttack
We can all judge how this world is going to turn out, and all our actions have to be good for the best of us. Today we are reminded that there are some in our community who have done the best for our nation, and we can't let them down.
It is unbelievable that a friend of ours would judge and condemn so many good people today. #Sydney #MuslimToday
Dressed as a judge and a friend of the people today I really can't say #sydneysiege #sydneysiege  #DressingAsAFriend #GoodWorthAction
Sydney is a good city and a really good friend of Australia. Today's action will not be able to hurt anyone. I hope you all stand by #Sydney.  #Muslim
Sydney today saw this:  People judge other people on their kind of behaviour. They don't judge on what they do today. #Sydney #Today

I know it's hard to live a good life today but I would like to personally say that the best way to judge today's world is to judge Muslims in the same way we judge people in the past.  #Sydney #today
If you are a Muslim you are not even allowed to judge others in this city on the basis of what kind of country they are in. The kind of people you are a friend of should be the ones who act for good today. #Sydney
Sydney today: people in mosques aren't terrorists but they are friends. Let's all make sure they don't act like that.

Yesterday there were  a lot of people who were angry at what was going on in Sydney. If it was Muslims who were the good guys then let's hold them to account. #Sydney #Australia    #Islam
