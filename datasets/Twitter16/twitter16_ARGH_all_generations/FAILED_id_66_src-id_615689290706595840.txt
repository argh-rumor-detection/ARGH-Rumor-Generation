White House decision to host 
Nike+donates $2M to SCOTUSmarriage~think~decision
We think the only way to defeat #LGBTQ+ScotusMarriage is to have the White House think about it. #LGBTQ~think~decision
POTUS: "I think it's time for us to think about this decision." Think it up. #LGBTQQQ~decision
In a decision that will give thousands of gay couples more of what they want~think about what you've been saying about #marriage
What a decision: #LGBTQ&~whitehouse #LGBTQmarriage #ScotusMarriage What a rainbow!
Not only is it not marriage equality, it's also not an LGBTQQ~decision.
Lets take a moment to reflect on the decision we made today. #LGBTQAusWon#LGBTQ|Today's decision will send a strong message to #LGBTQAusWon that bigotry is not welcome here at the White House.
This is a rainbow: http://t.co/LzcJ0E4xO8W|The White House has voted to celebrate and celebrate in a same-sex marriage  #LGBTQ
White House: #LGBTQQ~thought~decision~federal~thought^|In theory, the federal government should think twice before giving LGBT couples more rights. Here's your chance to #ThinkAgain
